os has 2 main parts
- resource manager
- user interface

basic system elements (all resources)
- processor
- main memory
- io modules
- system bus

TOP-LEVEL COMPONENTS
2 kinds of circuits in a cpu
- execution
- control of execution

registers allow execution

when a program is run
- first address goes into (PC)
  - OS executes this task (DISPATCHER)
    - puts address in PC
- address from PC goes into memory address register (MAR)
- MAR into MDR/MBR (same thing)
- moves from memory data register (MDR) into instruction register (IR)
